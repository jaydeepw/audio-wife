Caution!
==========
Eclipse library project structure has been dropped. If you wish to use this library in your eclipse IDE, please checkout [eclipse-develop][3].
No further development will be done or merged into [eclipse-develop][3] branch.


Why this project?
====================
1. A simple native audio player API wrapper
2. Others found were complex & provided no way to be integrate as library
3. Some even involved compilation using Android NDK


Features
=========
1. Provides default UI truly making it an integrable player.
2. Ability to set multiple custom click handlers to play and pause buttons.
3. No dependencies.


Including in your project
=========================

AudioWife is presented as an [Android library project][1].

You can include this project by [referencing it as a library project][2] in
Eclipse or ant.

This project has NO DEPENDENCIES.


Download
--------
Gradle:
```groovy

{
	compile 'net.the4thdimension:audio-wife:1.0.3'
}

```
Requires Android 4.0+.

Getting started
====================

Permission required to play audio

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```


## Using default player UI

AudioWife comes with a simple default player UI that you can use right away.
This is the simplest and fastest way to get AudioWife working.

```java
// mPlayerContainer = Parent view to add default player UI to.
AudioWife.getInstance().init(mContext, uri)
		.useDefaultUi(mPlayerContainer, getLayoutInflater());

```

## Using custom player UI

You can initialize the custom player controls of your UI using AudioWife

```java

// initialize the player controls
mPlayMedia = findViewById(R.id.play);
mPauseMedia = findViewById(R.id.pause);
mMediaSeekBar = (SeekBar) findViewById(R.id.media_seekbar);
mRunTime = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.run_time);
mTotalTime = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.total_time);

// AudioWife takes care of click handler for play/pause button
AudioWife.getInstance()
		 .init(mContext, uri)
		 .setPlayView(mPlayMedia)
		 .setPauseView(mPauseMedia)
		 .setSeekBar(mMediaSeekBar)
		 .setRuntimeView(mRunTime)
		 .setTotalTimeView(mTotalTime);

// to explicitly pause
AudioWife.getInstance().pause();


// when done playing, release the resources
AudioWife.getInstance().release();

```

## Add custom listeners

To extend the capabilities of AudioWife, custom click listeners can be attached.
Refer to source documentation for more details.

```java

AudioWife.getInstance().addOnCompletionListener( new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {
	
	@Override
	public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {
		Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "Completed", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
			 .show();
		// do you stuff
	}
});

AudioWife.getInstance().addOnPlayClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
	
	@Override
	public void onClick(View v) {
		Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "Play", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
			 .show();
		// Lights-Camera-Action. Lets dance.
	}
});

AudioWife.getInstance().addOnPauseClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
	
	@Override
	public void onClick(View v) {
		Toast.makeText(getBaseContext(), "Pause", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
			 .show();
		// Your on audio pause stuff.
	}
});
```

Why the name 'AudioWife'?
=========================
This relates with another Android AudioRecorder library project that is coming soon. 
The name AudioWife comes from an analogy of a married couple where the wife is an active Player, hence AudioWife
for Audio Player and husband being a Listener hence AudioHusband for Audio Recorder.

Later found that Audio Recorder Library project already exists for Android.
You can find it [here](https://github.com/steelkiwi/AndroidRecording).
